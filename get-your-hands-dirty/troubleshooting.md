## Device won't pair

Possible causes:

- Device is too far from the hub.
- Hub is offline.
- Wrong pairing mode on the device.

### Steps

1. Move device within 2 meters of hub.
2. Check hub LED status (solid green = ready).
3. Use the app's pairing log (Settings â†’ Diagnostics) to find errors.

## No automation triggers

- Check that the sensor reports events (see sensor page).
- Confirm timezone and clock on the hub.

## How to collect logs

Run the diagnostics bundle from the app and attach the ZIP to an issue. Include
the following:

- Hub serial
- App version
- Short reproduction steps
