# Git for docs: basics, not only for beginners

## Description

During this workshop you will learn the basics of Git. Together, we will explore
this amazing tool by not only getting our hands dirty with the most useful
commands but also by digging into the philosophy behind it and the way it works.
Mixing theory with practice will allow you to bridge gaps in your knowledge
about Git and build solid foundations for further development. That's why we
believe that not only beginners but also people who already have some Git skills
can benefit from this workshop.
