# Introduction â€” What HomeSphere is and who it's for

HomeSphere is a fictional, modular smart-home platform used in this course as an
example product for technical writers to learn Git workflows while practicing
real documentation tasks.

This mini docs repo models the kinds of content you will commonly write and
maintain for a smart home system: quick-starts, installation steps, device
pages, automation recipes, API snippets, and security notes.

## Who this is for

- Product writers and technical communicators documenting consumer smart-home
  products.
- Developer-doc writers who need to explain APIs and automation examples.
- Support writers and knowledge managers creating diagnostic guides and
  troubleshooting content.

## What you'll find here

- Concept pages (Overview, Devices, Scenes) that describe features and product
  terminology.
- Task-based guides (`getting-started.md`, `installation-and-setup.md`) with
  step-by-step instructions.
- Reference material (`api-reference.md`) with example requests and responses.
- Safety, security, and privacy guidance (`security-and-privacy.md`).

## Conventions used in the docs

- Command-line examples use fenced code blocks and the local `homesphere-cli`
  command.
- Device specs are shown as YAML/JSON snippets for clarity.
- Images live in the `assets/` folder and are referenced relative to each
  markdown file.
